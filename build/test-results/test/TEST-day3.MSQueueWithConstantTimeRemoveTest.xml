  <system-err><![CDATA[To make verification faster, you can specify the state equivalence relation on your sequential specification.
At the current moment, `IntQueueSequential` does not specify it, or the equivalence relation implementation is incorrect.
To fix this, please implement `equals()` and `hashCode()` functions on `IntQueueSequential`; the simplest way is to extend `VerifierState`
and override the `extractState()` function, which is called at once and the result of which is used for further `equals()` and `hashCode()` invocations.
